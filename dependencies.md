To run MÂ²aia on Ubuntu 18.04 you have to provide Qt 5.12 libraries >= Qt 5.12.9. Installers can be found in the [Qt 5.12] archive. In this example Qt is installed in the system folder ```/opt/``` to provide multi-user access.

To propergate the libraryes system wide, you can add a new entry

``` /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local_qt_5.12.conf ```

and add a single line e.g. pointing to

``` /opt/Qt5.12/5.12.9/gcc_64/lib ```

Finally, you have to run ```ldconfig``` to promote the new library search path.
